# Convolutions

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))
*In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.*
