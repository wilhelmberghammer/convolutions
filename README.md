When studying CNNs I wanted to implement the image processing algorithms from scratch.

*In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.*
